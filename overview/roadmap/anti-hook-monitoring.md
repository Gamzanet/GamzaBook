# Anti-hook Monitoring

Our project aims to enhance security within the Uniswap V4 ecosystem by operating an Anti-Hook Monitoring solution. This solution will continuously monitor Pool Manager contracts deployed on Uni Chain and rigorously analyze the security of Hooks configured during the initialization process. We comprehensively assess potential risks and vulnerabilities by leveraging dynamic and static analysis methods. Through dynamic analysis, we verify that Hooks function safely across various operational scenarios, while static analysis helps preemptively identify security flaws at the code level.

With this thorough examination, we intend to build an allowlist of verified Hooks, providing a secure environment that Uniswap users can trust. Furthermore, to offer a recognized security standard for developers and users alike, we plan to issue SBTs exclusively to certified Hook Contracts. This issuance reflects our commitment to security and the broader advancement of Uniswap V4 and Uni Chain. Through Anti-Hook Monitoring, we aim to strengthen the Uniswap V4 ecosystem and support a secure onboarding experience.
