# Uniswap v4 Hook

**Unified Security Framework and Trust Considerations**

Uniswap V4 has implemented a range of mechanisms to provide a secure and permissionless environment for user-defined liquidity operations, particularly through its new Hook functionality. However, this flexibility introduces certain risks and trust assumptions. Below, we explore the core security elements and specific considerations for maintaining robust user and liquidity provider trust.

***

**Core Security Components**

* **Singleton Architecture**
  * Uniswap V4’s core resides within the single `PoolManager` contract, centralizing the management of all pools and enforcing a controlled environment for liquidity operations.
  * This differs significantly from the previous version, where each pool operated within its individual contract, providing stronger guarantees on interaction consistency.
* **Hook Contract Security**
  * Hook contracts allow custom business logic to run before and after liquidity operations (e.g., `beforeAddLiquidity`, `afterRemoveLiquidity`), allowing advanced customization.
  * Given their direct interaction with token flows, Hooks may impose security risks if not designed correctly. Malicious Hooks could steal user assets or excessively inflate gas costs, which is why dynamic and static analysis tools, such as Herbicide, are recommended for threat detection.
* **Dynamic and Static Fee Management for Liquidity Providers**
  * Fees in Uniswap V4 can be either static or dynamically adjustable, configurable through Hooks at initialization. However, as dynamic fees can be updated on an ongoing basis, additional scrutiny on these adjustments is required to avoid exploitation.

**Critical Trust Assumptions**

1. **Transaction Security and Slippage Control**
   * Core contracts do not have built-in slippage protection, assuming that the periphery contracts will handle this function. Users and developers must ensure they use well-vetted periphery contracts to avoid excessive slippage in swaps.
2. **User and LP Asset Safety**
   * Reentrancy and unusual token contracts (e.g., rebase tokens) introduce unique vulnerabilities. To mitigate these, rigorous contract review and adherence to ERC-20 standards are critical.
   * Potentially malicious Hooks can alter swap or liquidity positions to the detriment of users, emphasizing the need for security mechanisms that check slippage and enforce LP protections.
3. **Permissions and Privilege Levels**
   * **Protocol Fee Controller**: Authorized to set protocol fees up to a capped 0.1% and to direct accrued fees.
   * **Owner**: Maintains the authority to update the Protocol Fee Controller.
   * **Hooks with Dynamic Fees**: Authorized to adjust fees on dynamically configured pools.
4. **Immutable Operations and Potential Upgradability**
   * Certain Hooks could theoretically include upgradability, which introduces post-deployment risk if unchecked. Users and LPs are encouraged to carefully review Hooks or use those audited by trusted entities.

#### **Mitigation Strategies**

To safeguard against the above risks, users, developers, and auditors are advised to:

* **Leverage Security Audits**: Routine analysis using dynamic and static tools, such as Herbicide’s Hook monitoring, can help detect and remediate vulnerabilities.
* **Implement Trustworthy Oracles**: Ensure Hooks rely on credible oracles when conducting price-sensitive operations.
* **Restrict Unauthorized Access**: Apply onlyPoolManager modifiers or similar controls on sensitive Hook functions.
* **Monitor for Malicious Activities**: Utilize security features within periphery contracts for additional slippage and transaction safety protections.
